# CSC591_Community_Detection
Dense subgraph extracation from sparse graph paper implementation
Implemented the paper which detects dense sub graph in a sparse graph.
Implemented the code base in python.
Please run the code as follows.

```
python dense_subgraph_detect <input_graph_file>
```
input file are present in amazon folder for reference.

## It requires the following package to run 
* networkx
* scipy
* numpy


You can install the above packeg using **pip install**.

Please refer the paper **GDM P2 paper** for algorithm implementation.
